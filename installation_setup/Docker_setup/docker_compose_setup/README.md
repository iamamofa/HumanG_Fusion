## How to Use

### 1️⃣ Build the Docker image
```bash
docker compose build
```
*(or if you already built it manually, skip this)*

---

### 2️⃣ Run an interactive container
```bash
docker compose run bioinf
```
You’ll drop into:
```bash
root@container:/data#
```
Inside, the conda environment `bioinf` is already active.

---

### 3️⃣ Mount data
All files in your local `./data/` directory are shared with `/data` inside the container:
```bash
mkdir data
cp some_reads.fastq data/
docker compose run bioinf fastqc some_reads.fastq
```

---

### 4️⃣ Reuse container
To keep it running as a long session (e.g., for Nextflow):
```bash
docker compose up -d
docker exec -it bioinf bash
```

---

### Optional: Nextflow Integration
If you plan to run Nextflow pipelines directly inside, you can use the same container, e.g.:
```bash
docker compose run bioinf nextflow run my_pipeline.nf -profile docker
```
Or include in the compose file:
```yaml
command: ["nextflow", "run", "my_pipeline.nf"]
```
